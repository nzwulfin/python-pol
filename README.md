## Setup and Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files as described):**
    ```bash
    # If you have it in a git repo:
    # git clone <your-repo-url>
    # cd host_details_app
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:**
    With your virtual environment activated, navigate to the project root directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Packages (Optional):**
    Edit `config.json` to add or remove Python and system packages you want to monitor.

5.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deployment

For production, do NOT use the Flask development server. Instead, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn, preferably behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.

### Using Gunicorn

### Using Gunicorn

1.  **Ensure Gunicorn is installed** (it should be if you ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
    If you ever need to install it or other packages separately:
    ```bash
    # pip install gunicorn # This is now covered by requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run with Gunicorn:**
    Navigate to your `host_details_app` directory. The Flask app instance is named `app` in `app.py`.
    ```bash
    gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
    ```
    * `--workers 4`: Adjust the number of worker processes based on your server's CPU cores (a common starting point is `2 * num_cores + 1`).
    * `--bind 0.0.0.0:8000`: Binds Gunicorn to port 8000 on all network interfaces. Choose a port that isn't in use.
    * `app:app`: Tells Gunicorn to look for an object named `app` inside the `app.py` module.

    You can also bind to a Unix socket, which is common when using a reverse proxy on the same machine:
    ```bash
    gunicorn --workers 4 --bind unix:/tmp/hostdetails.sock app:app
    # Ensure the directory for the socket is writable by the Gunicorn user.
    # /run/your_app_name/socket.sock is often preferred over /tmp for production.
    ```

### Option 1: Deploying with Gunicorn and Nginx (Recommended for Production)

Nginx will act as a reverse proxy, handling incoming HTTP(S) requests and forwarding them to Gunicorn.

1.  **Install Nginx:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install nginx
    # Or: sudo yum install nginx (for RHEL/CentOS)
    ```

2.  **Configure Nginx:**
    Create a new Nginx server block configuration file. For example, `/etc/nginx/sites-available/host_details`:
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80; # Or 443 if you have SSL
        server_name your_domain_or_server_ip; # e.g., details.example.com or your IP

        # Optional: Add access and error logs
        access_log /var/log/nginx/host_details_access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/host_details_error.log;

        location /static {
            # Path to your static files
            alias /path/to/your/host_details_app/static;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_pass [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000); # If Gunicorn is on port 8000
            # If using a Unix socket:
            # proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/hostdetails.sock;

            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```
    * Replace `/path/to/your/host_details_app/` with the actual absolute path to your application.
    * Replace `your_domain_or_server_ip` with your server's public IP address or domain name.
    * If Gunicorn is listening on a Unix socket, change `proxy_pass` accordingly.

3.  **Enable the Nginx configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/host_details /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo nginx -t # Test Nginx configuration
    sudo systemctl restart nginx # Or: sudo service nginx restart
    ```

4.  **Ensure Gunicorn is running** (e.g., using `systemd` or a process manager like Supervisor to keep it running in the background).

    **Example `systemd` service file (`/etc/systemd/system/host_details.service`):**
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn instance for Host Details Viewer
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=your_user                 # Replace with the user Gunicorn should run as
    Group=www-data               # Or your_user's group
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/host_details_app
    Environment="PATH=/path/to/your/host_details_app/venv/bin" # Path to virtualenv bin
    ExecStart=/path/to/your/host_details_app/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:/run/host_details/hostdetails.sock app:app
    # Ensure /run/host_details directory exists and is writable by 'your_user' or 'www-data'
    # Create it: sudo mkdir /run/host_details; sudo chown your_user:www-data /run/host_details

    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    * Replace `your_user`, `/path/to/your/host_details_app`, and paths to Gunicorn/Python in `venv`.
    * Then:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl start host_details
        sudo systemctl enable host_details # To start on boot
        sudo systemctl status host_details
        ```

### Option 2: Deploying with Gunicorn and Apache

Apache can also act as a reverse proxy using `mod_proxy`.

1.  **Install Apache and `mod_proxy`:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install apache2
    sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_balancer lbmethod_byrequests # Enable proxy modules
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    # Or: sudo yum install httpd (for RHEL/CentOS)
    ```

2.  **Configure Apache:**
    Create a new Apache virtual host configuration file. For example, `/etc/apache2/sites-available/host_details.conf`:
    ```apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName your_domain_or_server_ip

        # Optional: Add access and error logs
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/host_details_error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/host_details_access.log combined

        # Proxy requests to Gunicorn
        ProxyPreserveHost On
        ProxyPass /static ! # Don't proxy static files if serving them directly
        ProxyPass / [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
        ProxyPassReverse / [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

        # If Gunicorn is on a Unix socket (requires mod_proxy_unix):
        # sudo apt install libapache2-mod-proxy-unix # (or equivalent for your distro)
        # sudo a2enmod proxy_unix
        # ProxyPass / unix:/tmp/hostdetails.sock|http://localhost/

        # Serve static files directly via Apache for better performance
        Alias /static /path/to/your/host_details_app/static
        <Directory /path/to/your/host_details_app/static>
            Require all granted
        </Directory>

    </VirtualHost>
    ```
    * Replace paths and server name.
    * Ensure Gunicorn is running and listening on `127.0.0.1:8000` or the specified socket.

3.  **Enable the Apache configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo a2ensite host_details.conf
    sudo systemctl reload apache2 # Or: sudo service apache2 reload
    ```
    Ensure Gunicorn is running (e.g., using `systemd` as described in the Nginx section).

## Customization

* **Packages**: Modify `config.json` to change which Python and system packages are monitored.
* **Styling**: Edit `static/style.css` to change the appearance.
* **HTML**: Modify `templates/index.html` to alter the page structure or content.

## Troubleshooting

* **"Command not found" for system packages**: Ensure the relevant package manager (dpkg, rpm, pacman, brew) is installed and in the system's PATH for the user running the Flask/Gunicorn process.
* **"Permission denied" for socket file**: Ensure the user running Gunicorn has write permissions to the directory where the Unix socket is created, and the user running Nginx/Apache has read/write permissions to the socket file itself. Common practice is to create a dedicated directory in `/run/` for the socket.
* **Python Package "Not Found"**: Ensure the package is installed in the Python environment where the Flask application (and Gunicorn) is running. If using virtual environments, activate the correct one.
* **Check Gunicorn/Web Server Logs**:
    * Gunicorn output (if run directly)
    * Nginx: `/var/log/nginx/error.log` and `/var/log/nginx/access.log` (or your custom log paths).
    * Apache: `/var/log/apache2/error.log` and `/var/log/apache2/access.log` (or your custom log paths).
    * Systemd service logs: `sudo journalctl -u host_details.service`

## Running with Containers (Podman / Docker)

This project includes a `Containerfile` to build and run the application as a container, making deployment and distribution straightforward. The provided `Containerfile` uses a Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI 9) with Python 3.11. A `.dockerignore` file is also included to optimize the build process.

### Prerequisites for Containers

* A container engine installed, such as:
    * [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
    * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### 1. Building the Container Image

Navigate to the root directory of the `host_details_app` project in your terminal (where the `Containerfile` is located).

Run the following command to build the container image:

```bash
podman build -t host-details-app-ubi .
```

    podman build: The command to build an image from a Containerfile. (Docker users: replace podman with docker).
    -t host-details-app-ubi: Tags the image with the name host-details-app-ubi. You can choose a different name and tag (e.g., yourusername/appname:version).
    .: Specifies that the build context (including the Containerfile and application code) is the current directory.

2. Running the Container

Once the image is built successfully, you can run it using:
```bash

podman run -d -p 8080:8000 --name my-host-details-instance host-details-app-ubi
```

    podman run: The command to run a new container from an image. (Docker users: replace podman with docker).
    -d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    -p 8080:8000: Maps port 8080 on your host machine to port 8000 inside the container. The application inside the container (Gunicorn) listens on port 8000. You can change 8080 to any other available port on your host.
    --name my-host-details-instance: Assigns a unique name to your running container instance for easier management.
    host-details-app-ubi: The name of the image you want to run (which you specified during the build step).

3. Accessing the Application

After running the container, open your local web browser and navigate to:

    http://localhost:8080 (Or http://127.0.0.1:8080)

You should see the "Live Host Details" web application. The information displayed (OS, system packages) will reflect the environment inside the container (UBI 9), not your host machine (except for the kernel version, which is shared).
4. Managing the Container (Podman / Docker commands)
